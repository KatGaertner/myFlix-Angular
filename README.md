# MyFlix-Angular
This app is a partial rewrite of my [myFlix Movie Database App](https://github.com/KatGaertner/myFlix) using Angular. It provides users with a collection of movies, directors and genres, as well the ability to register an account and manage a list of favorite movies.

The app is connected to a MongoDB database through an [API built for this purpose](https://github.com/KatGaertner/movie_api).

The app is hosted on [Github Pages](https://katgaertner.github.io/myFlix-Angular/).  
**Demo Credentials**: As there is no verification, you can sign up using fake data, or use "testuser" with "testpassword".

## Features

- User Accounts: Users can create accounts and securely log in to gain access to the movie database.
- Movie Details: Users can view details about a movie, a director or a genre.
- Favorites List: Users can curate their own favorites list by adding and removing movies at their convenience.
